# Responsive

Handling responsive is very easy with `@xstyled/system` either using props or utilities.

## Create a responsive component

`breakpoints` is a utility to create mobile first responsive components.

```js
import styled, { css } from '@xstyled/styled-components'
import { breakpoints } from '@xstyled/system'

const Container = styled.div(
  breakpoints({
    xs: css`
      /* All devices */
    `,
    md: css`
      /* Up to md breakpoint */
    `,
    lg: css`
      /* Up to lg breakpoint */
    `,
  }),
)
```

Default good breakpoints are available. They can also be specified under the key `breakpoints` in your theme:

```js
// theme.js
export default {
  breakpoints: {
    xs: 0,
    sm: 576,
    md: 768,
    lg: 992,
    xl: 1200,
  },
}
```

The above breakpoints are the one used as default.

## Tweak a component for responsive

Using [system props](/docs/system-props/), you can tweak a component right from props. Each one of them accepts an object to define responsive values for each prop.

```js
import { Box } from '@xstyled/system'

/* The box will be displayed only in mobile! */
const OnlyMobileBox = () => <Box display={{ sm: 'block', md: 'none' }} />
```

See [system components](/docs/system-components/) to know how to use system props in your components.
