# Use with emotion

xstyled has complete support of [emotion](https://emotion.sh).

## Installation

To download xstyled run:

```bash
npm install @xstyled/emotion @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

## System as props

You can create your own system components with emotion:

```js
import styled from 'emotion-styled'
import { system } from '@xstyled/system'

const Box = styled.div(system)
```

## System as getters

System as getters are also available for emotion styled components.

```js
import styled from 'emotion-styled'
import { th } from '@xstyled/system'

const Box = styled.div`
  background-color: ${th.color('primary')};
`
```

## System as styled

System can also be used seamlessly in your CSS. `@xstyled/emotion` is a wrapper around `@emotion/styled` that gives you this power:

```js
import styled from '@xstyled/emotion'

const PrimaryBox = styled.div`
  width: 200px;
  height: 200px;
  background-color: primary;
`
```

The above example reads `primary` from `theme.colors`.

## Use css prop

xstyled also support emotion `css` property. The only thing you have to is importing `jsx` and `css` from `@xstyled/emotion`. See [emotion documentation](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop).

```js
/** @jsx jsx */
import { jsx, css } from '@xstyled/emotion'

function PrimaryBox() {
  return (
    <div
      css={css`
        width: 200px;
        height: 200px;
        background-color: primary;
      `}
    />
  )
}
```

The above example reads `primary` from `theme.colors`.

## Babel preset

To avoid the `/** @jsx jsx */` you can use `@xstyled/babel-preset-emotion-css-prop`. It has the same interface as `@emotion/babel-preset-css-prop`, see [emotion documentation](https://emotion.sh/docs/css-prop).

**.babelrc**

```json
{
  "presets": ["@xstyled/babel-preset-emotion-css-prop"]
}
```
