# Introduction

xstyled is a CSS-in-JS Framework built for React. It makes it easy to consistent design system and scale it over time.

## CSS-in-JS

CSS-in-JS allows you to write CSS directly in JavaScript. Writing CSS-in-JS has several advantages:

- **Local Scoping**: In CSS-in-JS, classnames are auto-generated, it means you can't clash with other libraries.
- **Encapsulation**: Style is defined directly in components. Two benefits from this: maintenance is easier and it ensures the separation of concern, your style is private to your component.
- **Portability**: Since components have their own styled, they can easily be shared or reused in other projects.
- **Dynamic**: JavaScript makes your CSS dynamic, you can apply complex color tranformations, interact with user, creates complex animation on the fly... It is really a game changer.

[Emotion](https://emotion.sh/) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) are the two main CSS-in-JS library for React. xstyled is built on top of them, the library is the core of xstyled, but you don't have to know specifity, just pick one and start coding.

## Story

In 2018, I created a web agency. We started to work on several projects. But in every project, we were doing the same thing, the same components, again and again. So I created a library called [Smooth UI](https://github.com/smooth-code/smooth-ui/). The goal was simple, provide a set of base components.

After a year of Smooth UI, I figured out that base components was not enough. I wanted to be able to reuse some low level utilities to create original components quickly in every projects. Every project is different, re-using a component from a project to another is difficult. However reusing libraries and utilities is possible. So I give to Smooth UI a system, a base component with utility props inspired from [styled-system](https://styled-system.com/).

The system becomes bigger and bigger, so I decided to isolate it in a library. First, I [tried to contribute](https://github.com/styled-system/styled-system/pull/479) but I had different vision from Brent Jackson. xstyled was born!

I introduced xstyled on many project during a year and more, every time it was well received and a boost of productivity for teams.

In 2020, I discovered [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), I was impressed by the quality of the project. The documentation, the utilities, everything was good. It reminds me a lot xstyled, in fact xstyled v1 was very closed to Tailwind but documentation was a disaster... The core of xstyled was good enough to scale and to become a Tailwind like framework for CSS-in-JS world. So I decided to work on a v2.

xstyled v2 is the outcome of several years of experience on dozen of projects to optimize performance and productivity.
