# Preflight

An opinionated set of base styles for xstyled projects.

<carbon-ad />

Inspired from [Tailwind's Preflight](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/preflight) and build on top of [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize), Preflight is a set of base styles for xstyled projects that are designed to smooth over cross-browser inconsistencies and make it easier for you to work within the constraints of your design system.

Preflight is available as a Global Style React Component, when mounted styles are automatically injected.

```js
import { Preflight } from '@xstyled/...'

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <Preflight />
      {/* ... */}
    </>
  )
}
```

## Default margins are removed

Preflight removes all of the default margins from elements like headings, blockquotes, paragraphs, etc.

```css
blockquote,
dl,
dd,
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6,
hr,
figure,
p,
pre {
  margin: 0;
}
```

This makes it harder to accidentally rely on margin values applied by the user-agent stylesheet that are not part of your spacing scale.

## Headings are unstyled

All heading elements are completely unstyled by default, and have the same font-size and font-weight as normal text.

```css
h1,
h2,
h3,
h4,
h5,
h6 {
  font-size: inherit;
  font-weight: inherit;
}
```

The reason for this is two-fold:

- **It helps you avoid accidentally deviating from your type scale**. By default, the browsers assigns sizes to headings that don't exist in Tailwind's default type scale, and aren't guaranteed to exist in your own type scale.
- **In UI development, headings should often be visually de-emphasized**. Making headings unstyled by default means any styling you apply to headings happens consciously and deliberately.

You can always add default header styles to your project by [adding your own base styles](/docs/adding-base-styles/).

## Lists are unstyled

Ordered and unordered lists are unstyled by default, with no bullets/numbers and no margin or padding.

```css
ol,
ul {
  list-style: none;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

If you'd like to style a list, you can do so using the [listStyleType](/docs/list-style-type/) and [listStylePosition](/docs/list-style-position/) utilities:

```jsx
<x.ul listStyleType="disc" listStylePosition="inside">
  <li>One</li>
  <li>Two</li>
  <li>Three</li>
</x.ul>
```

You can always add default header styles to your project by [adding your own base styles](/docs/adding-base-styles/).

## Images are block-level

Images and other replaced elements (like `svg`, `video`, `canvas`, and others) are `display: block` by default.

```css
img,
svg,
video,
canvas,
audio,
iframe,
embed,
object {
  display: block;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

This helps to avoid unexpected alignment issues that you often run into using the browser default of `display: inline`.

If you ever need to make one of these elements `inline` instead of `block`, simply use the `display="inline"` utility:

```jsx
<x.img display="inline" src="..." alt="..." />
```

## Border styles are reset globally

In order to make it easy to add a border by simply adding the `border` utility, xstyled overrides the default border styles for all elements with the following rules:

```css
*,
::before,
::after {
  border-width: 0;
  border-style: solid;
  border-color: ${th.color('default-border-color', 'currentColor')};
}
```

Since the `border` utiity only sets the `border-width` and `border-style` property, this reset ensures that adding that class always adds a solid 1px border using your configured default border color.

This can cause some unexpected results when integrating certain third-party libraries, like [Google maps](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/issues/484) for example.

When you run into situations like this, you can work around them by overriding the Preflight styles with your own custom CSS:

```css
.google-map * {
  border-style: none;
}
```

## Buttons have a default outline

To ensure that we provide accessible styles out of the box, we made sure
that buttons have a default outline. You can of course override this by
applying `focusRing` or similar utilities to your buttons.

```css
button:focus {
  outline: 1px dotted;
  outline: 5px auto -webkit-focus-ring-color;
}
```

## Buttons have pointer

To ensure accessibility, buttons have pointer.

```css
/* Role button pointer */
[role='button'],
button {
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

## Default ring color

A default ring color is added by Preflight to ensure that default `ring` utility color is good.

```css
* {
  --x-ring-color: ${th.color('default-ring-color', 'rgba(59,130,246,0.5)')};
}
```

## Extending Preflight

You can't extend or modify `Preflight`, however you can additional [add base styles](/docs/adding-base-styles).
