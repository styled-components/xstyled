# Responsive Design

Create adaptive user interfaces using responsive utilities.

<carbon-ad />

Every xstyled's utilities can be applied conditionally at different breakpoints, it makes it easy to build complex responsive interfaces.

There are five breakpoints by default, inspired by common device resolutions:

| Breakpoint prefix | Minimum width    | CSS                                  |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `_` or `xs`       | No minimum width | `{ ... }`                            |
| `sm`              | `640px;`         | `@media (min-width: 640px) { ... }`  |
| `md`              | `768px;`         | `@media (min-width: 768px) { ... }`  |
| `lg`              | `1024px;`        | `@media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }` |
| `xl`              | `1280px;`        | `@media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }` |
| `2xl`             | `1536px;`        | `@media (min-width: 1536px) { ... }` |

Every props accepts an object syntax to define a value for each breakpoints:

```js
// Width of 16 by default, 32 on medium screens, and 48 on large screens
<x.img w={{ _: 16, md: 32, lg: 48 }} src="..." />
```

This works for every utility prop in the framework, which means you can change literally anything at a given breakpoint — even things like letter spacing or cursor styles.

Here's a simple example of a marketing page component that uses a stacked layout on small screens, and a side-by-side layout on larger screens (resize your browser to see it in action):

```jsx preview color=pink
<>
  <template preview>
    <x.div
      maxWidth={{ _: 'md', md: '2xl' }}
      mx="auto"
      bg="white"
      borderRadius="xl"
      boxShadow="md"
      overflow="hidden"
    >
      <x.div display={{ md: 'flex' }}>
        <x.div flexShrink={{ md: 0 }}>
          <x.img
            h={48}
            w={{ _: '100%', md: 48 }}
            objectFit="cover"

            alt="Man looking at item at a store"
          />
        </x.div>
        <x.div p={8}>
          <x.div
            textTransform="uppercase"

          fontSize="sm"
          color="pink-500"
          fontWeight="semibold"
        >
          Case study
        </x.div>
        <x.a
          href="#"
          display="block"
          mt={1}
          fontSize="lg"
          lineHeight="tight"
          fontWeight="medium"
          color="black"
          textDecoration={{ hover: 'underline' }}
        >
          Finding customers for your new business
        </x.a>
        <x.p mt={2} color="gray-500">
          Getting a new business off the ground is a lot of hard work. Here are
          five ideas you can use to find your first customers.
        </x.p>
      </x.div>
    </x.div>
  </x.div>
</>
```

Here's how the example above works:

- By default, the outer `div` is `display: block`, but by adding the `display={{ md: 'flex' }}` utility, it becomes `display: flex` on medium screens and larger.
- When the parent is a flex container, we want to make sure the image never shrinks, so we've added `flexShrink={{ md: 0 }}` to prevent shrinking on medium screens and larger. Technically we could have just used `flexShrink={0}` since it would do nothing on smaller screens, but since it only matters on `md` screens, it's a good idea to make that clear.
- On small screens the image is automatically full width by default. On medium screens and up, we've constrained that width to a fixed size using `w={{ md: 48 }}`.

We've only used one breakpoint in this example, but you could easily customize this component at other sizes using the `sm`, `lg`, or `xl` responsive prefixes as well.

## Mobile First

By default, xstyled uses a mobile first breakpoint system, similar to what you might be used to in other frameworks like Bootstrap.

What this means is that by default properties take effect on all screen sizes. While object syntax enables customization for a specific breakpoint and above.

### Targeting mobile screens

To target a small screen, you don't have to specify anything:

```js
// Center text on all screen sizes
<x.div textAlign="center" />

// Center text on all screen sizes
<x.div textAlign={{ _: "center" }} />

// Center text on screens smaller than 640px, and left align it on screens 640px and wider
<x.div textAlign={{ _: "center", md: 'left' }} />
```

Because of the mobile first approach of xstyled, it is always a good idea to implement the mobile layout for a design first, then layer on any changes that make sense for `sm` screens, followed by `md` screens, etc.

### Targeting a single breakpoint

xstyled's breakpoints only include a `min-width` and don't include a `max-width`, which means any utilities you add at a smaller breakpoint will also be applied at larger breakpoints.

If you'd like to apply a utility at one breakpoint only, the solution is to undo that utility at larger sizes by adding another utility that counteracts it.

Here is an example where the background color is red at the `md` breakpoint, but teal at every other breakpoint:

```js
<x.div bg={{ _: 'teal-500', md: 'red-500', lg: 'teal-500' }} />
```

Notice that **we did not** have to specify a background color for the `sm` breakpoint or the `xl` breakpoint — you only need to specify when a utility should start taking effect, not when it should stop.

## Using media queries in `styled.*`

You can reference screens directly in `min-width` and `max-width` media queries:

```js
import styled from '@xstyled/...'

const Colorful = styled.div`
  background-color: papayawhip;
  @media (min-width: md) and (max-width: lg) {
    background-color: rebeccapurple;
  }
```

For `max-width`, xstyled reduces the breakpoint slightly to avoid matching at the exact value. With the default breakpoints, this example translates to a minimum width of `768px` and a maximum width of `1023.98px`.

## Customizing breakpoints

You can completely customize breakpoints in your theme:

```js
// theme.js

export const theme = {
  screens: {
    tablet: 640,
    // => @media (min-width: 640px) { ... }

    laptop: 1024,
    // => @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }

    desktop: 1280,
    // => @media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }
  },
}
```
