# Migrate from styled-components

In most of case, you can safely migrate your code from `styled-components` and use `@xstyled/styled-components` instead. xstyled is just a wrapper around `styled-components`, it is not another engine. xstyled is just a little more strict, if you don't follow the rule it will work but the magic will not apply!

## CSS as object

CSS as object already does magic on your properties, for example a `margin` is automatically converted in `px`. To avoid any problem of migration, xstyled magic only applies on `string` properties.

```js
import styled from '@xstyled/styled-components'

const Box = styled.div({
  margin: 2, // '2px' (not transformed by xstyled)
  marginTop: '2', // '8px' (transformed by styled)
})
```

You can safely migrate a code base to `@xstyled/styled-components` without any issue.

## `css` utility is required

With xstyled, you need to explicitely transforms your CSS using `css` utility:

```js
import styled, { css } from '@xstyled/styled-components'

// 🚫 Not good
const Box = styled.div`
  ${(p) => ({ margin: p.margin })}
`

// ✅ Good
const Box = styled.div`
  ${(p) => css({ margin: p.margin })}
`
```

## Complete CSS property

xstyled transforms css properties. You have to write complete CSS properties and not use function interpolation in the middle of your CSS declaration.

```js
import styled from '@xstyled/styled-components'

// 🚫 Not good
const Box = styled.div`
  margin: ${(p) => p.margin};
`

// ✅ Good
const Box = styled.div`
  ${(p) => css`
    margin: ${p.margin};
  `}
`
```

## CSS property

[Styled Components CSS property](https://styled-components.com/docs/api#css-prop) is not supported by xstyled and it will not be supported.

Styled Components CSS property rely on a Babel transformation to work. Some edge-cases like using state in a CSS property are not supported:

```js
function Example() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(false)
  return (
    <div
      css={`
        color: ${value ? 'red' : 'blue'};
      `}
    />
  )
}
```

The above code does not work. Since CSS property support is not good, I prefer to not encourage its usage in xstyled.
