# Getting Started

Follow these few steps to get ready with xstyled.

## Introduction

xstyled is composed of two packages `@xstyled/system` and `@xstyled/styled-components`:

- `@xstyled/system` exposes all core utilities, it is similar to `styled-system` and it works with `styled-components` and `emotion`.
- `@xstyled/styled-components` is a wrapper around `styled-components` to enable the system directly in the CSS syntax.

If you wonder why we need both or why we don't use `styled-system`, read [Motivation](/docs/motivation/) first.

## Installation

To download xstyled run:

```bash
npm install @xstyled/styled-components styled-components
```

That's all you need to do, you are now ready to use it in your app! (yep, no build step needed 👌)

> xstyled is just a wrapper around styled-components, it means that it is recommended (but not required) to also use the [styled-components Babel plugin](https://github.com/styled-components/babel-plugin-styled-components) if you can. It offers many benefits like more legible class names, server-side rendering compatibility, smaller bundles, and more.

If you want to use emotion instead, see [Use with emotion](/docs/emotion)

## Style your first component

If you are familiar with styled-components, xstyled is the same thing with super powers!

Instead of importing `styled-components`, use `@xstyled/styled-components`.

```js
import styled from '@xstyled/styled-components'

const Button = styled.button``
```

You can style this button with CSS of course, but also with system based CSS. Let's try it:

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  background: transparent;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 2px solid;
  border-color: violet;
  color: violet;
  margin: 0 16px;
  padding: 4px 16px;
`
```

The above button is only CSS. It is great, but it would be nice to replace everything with theme based value, let's try it.

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  background: transparent;
  border-radius: 3px;
  border: 2px solid;
  border-color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.primary};
  color: ${(props) => props.theme.colors.primary};
  margin: 0 ${(props) => props.theme.space[3]};
  padding: ${(props) => props.theme.space[1]} ${(props) => props.theme.space[3]};
`
```

That's ugly isn't it? xstyled syntax simplifies it! It brings the power of `@xstyled/system` right in CSS syntax:

```js
const Button = styled.button`
  background: transparent;
  border-radius: 3;
  border: 2;
  border-color: primary;
  color: primary;
  margin: 0 3;
  padding: 1 3;
`
```

You can now use all your theme based values in your CSS!

If it looks too magic for you? Start with [theme getters](/docs/system-utilities/#theme-getters).
